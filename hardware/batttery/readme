I used two of these 24Ah 12V leadacid batteries. Be carefull when chosing a battery that it's not equiped with some kind of security that shuts the battery down if you pull to much current. Also keep in mind that if you use motors that the battery needs to be strong enough to deliver the starting current (at least 9 times the nominal current). You can also solve it by just starting really slow.
The batteries are switched in serie so we get 24V. There is also a branch for the 12V users like the fan. The Raspberry pi works on 5.5V so I created another branch from the 12V one with a stepdownmodule for the 5.5V consumers.
