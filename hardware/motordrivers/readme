All my motordrivers are from Cytron. I would really recommend them, they are cheap and really user-friendly. For the linieare motors and the ledstrip I used the 10A one with a 13A max current. The bigger motor in the back got the 20A with a 60A max current motor controller. The motorcontroller_schema picture shows how to connect them and how easy they are to work with.
You connect your controller, in my case a Raspberry pi to the ground, pwm and direction pins. To power the motors you need an external source in my case two 12V batteries in parrallell. Then just put the two wires of the motor in the A and B port. There are two buttons by which you can manually test everything.
