All my motordrivers are from Cytron. I would really recommend them, they are cheap and really user-friendly. For the linieare motors and the ledstrip I used the 10A one with a 13A max current. The bigger motor in the back got the 20A with a 60A max current motor controller. The motorcontroller_schema picture shows how to connect them and how easy they are to work with.
