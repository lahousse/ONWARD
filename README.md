The goal of the project was to develop a userfriendly, creative and smart selfdriving car which could transport a person. I started with the basis from which I then kept on expanding and improving. The basis is just a plain old electric car which I build from an old gocart. I then added an app, voice assistant, face id, cloud connection, link with drone and I made it selfdriving. This project is 100% in Python and everything works on one Raspberry Pi.
