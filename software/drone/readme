You might think why the hell would you link a drone with a vehicle? Well, most selfdriving cars that use cameras use the superimpose techique. With this technique it's possible to take a picture above the original picture but from birds eye view. They do this to get a better shot at calculating the corner of the street.
This all works perfeclty but to constantly use this process on a Raspberry pi certainly in realtime and in parrallell with other processes this is just a pain in the ass. 
So I thought I might as well solve this problem with some flair and create my own bird that actually takes pictures from the birds eye perspective. 
I used a Tello drone. This is an amazing user-friendly, cheap and python programmable drone. But then the hard part. How do you make the drone follow the car? With the objecttracking script you can perfectly track a certain color. In my case the drone follow a yellow circle on the back of the vehicle. Do be carefull when chosing a color. I had some trouble in areas that were lit with those yellow cosy lights.
The drones library is equiped with function that calculate some really usefull stuff like the speed and hight of the drone. The drone sends all its measurements to the cloud.
