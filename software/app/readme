I used the blynk interface as the app to control the vehicle. Blynk is made for easy interacting with IOT. You do need wifi or bleutooth to connect with the device. You download blynk on your phone, create an app with fysical numbering for the buttons. You use the same numbering in your script. You copy an unique code that you can then paste in your python script. My blynk.py script schows how you can control the rood, leds and the driving with a Raspberry pi from your phone.
